      # `file` is relative to .strigo directory. Don't include number in title--that happens automatically.
      #In Atom, create the file and title here. Then edit the MD file.
      #Use https://euangoddard.github.io/clipboard2markdown/  to create the clipboard2markdown
      #Add <head><base target="_blank"> </head> to the top of the MD file.
      #Add Click "Next" to the end of each MD file. Add Click "Done" to the final MD file.
      # Use title ####. It's the best size.
      #Don't include numbers in titles; you'll just regret it later on.
