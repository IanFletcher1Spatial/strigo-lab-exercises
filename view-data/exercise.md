When you click Run the Translation Log appears and informs you of the results of running the workspace. This log lets you view any warnings or errors for debugging. It will report `Translation was SUCCESSFUL` after it is finished running.

Note the numbers next to each feature type. These are feature counts and represent how many features (or rows) of data were read.

3. If you are inspecting both caches at once, you can change feature types in Table View by clicking the drop-down under Table.
