1. Run Workspace

Click the green "play" button on the Toolbar, the Run button, to run your workspace.

The workspace runs and feature caches, locally stored versions of the data, are created. They look like green magnifying glasses. You can view them by clicking the green magnifying glass icon on each feature type. Ctrl-clicking (or Cmd on Mac) lets you view multiple caches at once.

Note the Translation Log appears and informs you of the results of running the workspace. This log lets you view any warnings or errors for debugging.

Note the numbers next to each feature type. These are feature counts and represent how many features (or rows) of data were read.

2. Inspect the Construction Projects and Food Vendors

Ctrl-click (or Cmd on a Mac) the caches on "road-ahead-upcoming-projects" and the reader feature type we just looked at in the Navigator, the food vendors "CSV." You will see the location of the construction projects and food vendors appear on a map in the Visual Preview window.

3. Explore the Visual Preview Capabilities

- Zoom in on some data using your mouse wheel or the Zoom In tool in the Visual Preview > Graphics Toolbar (above the map).
- Click a feature in Graphics View to view its attributes in Table View. Try the other way, clicking a row in Table View to see the feature highlighted in Graphics view.
- Change feature types in Table View by clicking the drop-down under Table.
