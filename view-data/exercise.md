1. Run Workspace

Click the green "play" button on the Toolbar, the Run button, to run your workspace.

The Translation Parameter Values dialog will appear. This dialog lets you set parameters that you might want to change each time you run the workspace, for example, the source data and destination path. For now we'll keep the defaults; click Run.

The workspace runs and feature caches, locally stored versions of the data, are created. You can view them by clicking the green magnifying glass icon on each feature type. Ctrl-clicking (or Cmd on Mac) lets you view multiple caches at once.

Note the Translation Log appears and informs you of the results of running the workspace. This log lets you view any warnings or errors for debugging.

Note the numbers next to each feature type. These are feature counts and represent how many features (or rows) of data were read.

2. Inspect the Construction Projects and Food Vendors

Ctrl-click (or Cmd on a Mac) the caches on "road-ahead-upcoming-projects" and "CSV". You will see the location of the construction projects and food vendors appear on a map in the Visual Preview window.

You can zoom in to see their general locations using your mouse wheel or the Zoom In tool in the Visual Preview Toolbar.

Click a feature to view its attributes in Table View. Change feature types in Table View by clicking the drop-down under Table.
