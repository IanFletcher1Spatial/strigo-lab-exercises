#### 1. Run Workspace

Click the green "play" button on the Toolbar, the Run button, to run your workspace.

When you click Run the Translation Log appears and informs you of the results of running the workspace. This log lets you view any warnings or errors for debugging. It will report `Translation was SUCCESSFUL` after it is finished running.

As the workspace runs it creates feature caches, locally stored versions of the data. They look like green magnifying glasses. You can view the data at that point in the workspace by clicking the green magnifying glass icons. Ctrl-clicking (or Cmd on Mac) multiple caches in sequence lets you view multiple at once.

Note the numbers next to each feature type. These are feature counts and represent how many features (or rows) of data were read.

#### 2. Inspect the Construction Projects and Food Vendors

Click the cache on the "road-ahead-upcoming-projects" reader feature type. You will see the location of the construction projects appear on a map in the Visual Preview window.

Optionally, you can click the food vendors "CSV" reader feature type cache to inspect it. To inspect both together, Ctrl-click one cache icon after another (or Cmd on Mac).

#### 3. Explore Visual Preview

- Zoom in on some data using your mouse wheel or the Zoom In tool in the Visual Preview > Graphics Toolbar (above the map).
- Click a feature in Graphics View to view its attributes in Table View. Try the other way, clicking a row in Table View to see the feature highlighted in Graphics view.
- If you are inspecting both caches at once, you can change feature types in Table View by clicking the drop-down under Table.
